\section{Getting angles}
We have three angles, \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\). These can be represented as three
components of a vector:
\[ r = \left\langle x, y, z \right\rangle \]

The magnitude of this vector should be \emph{approximately} equal to the
acceleration due to gravity, \(9.8{\text{m/s}}^2\).
